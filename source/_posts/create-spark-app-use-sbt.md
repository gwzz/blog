## What is SBT?
sbt is an open source build tool for Scala and Java projects, similar to Java's Maven or Ant.

Its main features are:

* native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks
* build descriptions written in Scala using a DSL
* dependency management using Ivy (which supports Maven-format repositories)
* continuous compilation, testing, and deployment
* integration with the Scala interpreter for rapid iteration and debugging
* support for mixed Java/Scala projects

sbt is the de facto build tool in the Scala communityï¼Œ used by the Lift web framework and Play Framework.
