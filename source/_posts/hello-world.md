This is the first post of my blog. Just like the classic program's first output. "Hello World!" is also what I want to say to the world. This blog uses **hexo** and is deployed on the **github** pages.

Why I create this blog? Write down what I learned, share what I thought useful, record something needs to be backup, and show something interesting.

Currently, there are only common posts and galleries in this blog. The contents of my blog are rare. However, I am keeping adding things now.

I will keep going modify this file as the contents and structure of this blog changes.
